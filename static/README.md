# Wish4

Website built to hold and organize wishlists, linking to different sites so that all can be stored in one place

## Getting Started

At the top right you will see My Lists. Click to view your wishlists.
Next to My Lists there is a plus button. Click to create a new list.
From inside a wishlist, click Add Item to add a new item to the list.
Enter all the correct information you would like displayed.
To display an image of the item, enter the image address.
To get this address, right click the image from the website it is from.
Click "Copy Image Address" and paste into the form.
All information can be changed later with the Edit button from the dropdown menu labelled "Options". The same goes for the wishlist itself. Next to "Edit" there is a button to delete the selected item or wishlist. Please refrain from making any changes on lists that are not yours.
